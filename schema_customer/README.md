## Schema Repository Structure

To register schemas through pipeline, each schema needs its own repository. Here is the structure of the repo which contains the required files, including the Avro schema. 

```console
- schema_customer
 -- src/main/resources/avro
    --- customer.avsc
 -- buildspec.yaml
 -- manifest.yaml
 -- pom.xml
 -- settings.xml
```
1. customer.avsc - Avro schema file that needs to be registered with AWS Glue Schema Registry.
2. buildspec.yml - AWS CodeBuild spec file, containing build details.
3. manifest.yml â€“ Manifest file which contains details regarding the schema registry, schema, compatibility mode, and other details required to register the schema with AWS Glue Schema Registry.
4. settings.xml - Maven configuration indicating where the artifact should be placed.

## manifest.yml structure

The YAML manifest file contains information about pipeline actions. Here is the sample manifest file
```console
